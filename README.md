# Video-and-Image-Compression-Using-MATLAB
In this Project, I use MATLAB to develop a basic encoder and decoder algorithms for images and videos.

Basically, this project was done in 3 steps.
  Step 1 : Image Compression
  Step 2 : Video Compression
  Step 3 : Optimazation

So, here the codes are applied as seperate files for these tasks.
(Note that the step 3 is involved in the both step 1 and step 2 codes.)
